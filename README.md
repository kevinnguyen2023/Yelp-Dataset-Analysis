# Yelp Dataset Analysis
In this project, I will be using SQL to answer specific questions for an organization and make inferences based on my discoveries. See file "Analyzing_Yelp_Dataset.txt"

I will be using a dataset from a US-based organization called Yelp, which provides a platform for users to provide reviews and rate their interactions with a variety of organizations â€“ businesses, restaurants, health clubs, hospitals, local governmental offices, charitable organizations, etc. Yelp has made a portion of this data available for personal, educational, and academic purposes.

I will be analyzing a series of questions regarding the data to help profile and better understand the data in the first part of the assignment. Once I have answered each question, I will come up with my own question for analysis and prepare a dataset for the analysis I choose to do in the second part of the assignment.
